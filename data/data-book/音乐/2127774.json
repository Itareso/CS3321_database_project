It is also the first book in this language to offer an in-depth analysis of his music. T^D-oru Takemitsu's works are increasingly popular with Western audiences and Peter Burt attempts for the first time to shed light on the hitherto rather secretive world of his working methods, as well as place him in context as heir to the rich tradition of Japanese composition in the twentieth century.\n\n        \n      ",
