Renowned music journalist Simon Reynolds celebrates the futurist spirit of  such bands as Joy Division, Gang of Four, Talking Heads, and Devo, which resulted in endless innovations  in music, lyrics, performance, and style and continued into the early eighties with the video-savvy synth- pop of groups such as Human League, Depeche Mode, and Soft Cell, whose success coincided with the rise  of MTV. Full of insight and anecdote and populated by charismatic characters,  Rip It Up  re-creates  the idealism, urgency, and excitement of one of the most important and challenging periods in the history  of popular music.\n\n        \n      ",
