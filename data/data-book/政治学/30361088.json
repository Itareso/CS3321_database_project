Written by communica tion scholars from the U.S. and China, the eight chapters examine the history, mobilization and organization of the new cyber-nationalism, the evolution of symbolic devices, and the impact of ICTs, consumerism, fan culture, and internet subcultures on cyber nationalism. Situating the “Diba expedition” and the new cyber-nationalism in the media ecology of social media, mobile internet, smart mobile phones and other new-generation ICTs, the authors illuminate the changing meanings of Chinese political culture under the influences of official nationalistic education, commercial culture, and grassroots internet culture.    https://www.routledge.com/From-Cyber-Nationalism-to-Fandom-Nationalism-The-Case-of-Diba-Expedition/Hailong/p/book/9781138330641\n\n        \n      ",
